- Little bit about me......
- I'm 21 years old, got into coding about 3-4 weeks ago, I've spent most of my life buying, buildinng, and seling cars.
-  I drink beer like it's water and smoke weed like it's oxygen lol.
- I live and breathe race cars.
- I got into coding because the idea of it has always entertained me and now i finally have some of the equipment to be able to do so.
- I know I don't know much and I'm definetly not very good lol but that's why I'm here hoping someone would be down to have a beer and show me how its done.
- CHEERS!!
